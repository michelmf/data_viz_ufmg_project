## 5. Conclusion
- Return to the initial question and answer it based on your analysis.
- Suggest possible directions for future research.

## 6. Presentation
- Your presentation should be objective, emphasizing the main stages of the analysis.
- Use slides with graphs, tables, and a clear logical structure.
- Estimated time for each presentation: 10 to 15 minutes.
